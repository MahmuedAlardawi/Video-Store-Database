# Video Rental Database Design - CPCS-241 Lab Assignment

## Introduction
This project outlines the creation and management of a database for a video rental service. It includes detailed schema design for storing videos, categories, copies, customers, and rental transactions. The project utilizes SQL for database implementation and operations, focusing on real-world application scenarios typical in video rental businesses.

## Key Features

- **Database Schema**: Defines tables for videos, video categories, copies of videos, customers, and rentals.
- **Data Integrity and Constraints**: Implements primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints to ensure data integrity.
- **User Creation and Rights Assignment**: Details steps for creating a database user and assigning the necessary rights for operation.
- **Data Manipulation**: Includes SQL scripts for inserting data into tables, ensuring unique entries, and managing video rentals.
- **Program Units**: Develops program units for inserting new videos, customers, and managing rental transactions.
- **Reports Generation**: Provides SQL queries to generate reports on videos, customers, and rentals, offering insights into the rental business operations.

## Technical Requirements

- **SQL Development**: Utilizes SQL for all database design and manipulation tasks.
- **Primary and Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensures relational integrity among different tables in the database.
- **Unique Constraints and Checks**: Implements uniqueness checks to prevent duplicate entries for critical identifiers.
- **Date Handling**: Manages rental periods and transactions using SQL date functions.

## Objective

To design a fully functional database for a video rental service that supports transaction management, customer handling, and inventory control. This project aims to provide practical experience with database schema design, SQL programming, and real-world data management strategies.

## How to Use

1. **User Setup**: Begin by creating a database user specific for the video rental operations.
2. **Schema Creation**: Execute the provided SQL scripts to create the necessary tables and relationships.
3. **Data Insertion**: Use the scripts to populate the database with initial data for video categories and video information.
4. **Transaction Management**: Implement the program units to handle new rentals and return processes.
5. **Reporting**: Run the provided queries to generate reports on video inventory, customer details, and rental transactions.

This README provides a detailed guide to setting up and managing a database for a video rental service, ideal for academic purposes or business applications.

Explore the structured SQL scripts and program units to understand the operational dynamics of a video rental database and gain practical skills in SQL database management.
